# MajiMods Modpack
MajiMods is a modpack for Minecraft 1.20.1 using the Forge modloader.

It is a based on adding a **huge number of functionnaliy and additions** to the game, while still having the feeling of playing **vanilla** Minecraft.
This modpack is perfect for those who get bored of the base game but don't like having too many mods and not knowing where to start or what to do.

**QoL and enhancements mods** are also included so you don't have to install anything yourself, everything you need is very probably in the modpack, the modpack is even compatible with VR out of the box!

## Why is this on GitHub?
This modpack got refused from Modrinth because of some mods, so instead it's hosted on GitHub.
